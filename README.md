# nGram-LM

This project is an easy and educational implementation of a language model in PHP, specifically based on a [Markov Chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain). 
In simple terms, a Markov Chain involves predicting the next step in a sequence based only on the current step, without taking 
into account the history of previous steps. In the case of a language model, this means predicting the next word based 
on the preceding words.

This repository contains an educational implementation of a language model in PHP. The code demonstrates how to construct,
train, and use an n-gram language model for text generation. 

It's a simple but good example for understanding the basics of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and how statistical
language models work. 

The model is trained on a text file with the 7 books of Harry Potter, serialized for future use, and then used to
generate new sentences based on the probabilities of word sequences in the training data.

# How to use
First extend memory_limit in your php.ini to 10240M (10gb) aprox.
and also max_execution_time to 300 seconds.

In the first run if there is no "trained" file in the directory it will train the model, it could take some time,
depending on your hardware.

You can adjust the value of the **$ngrams** variable prior to running the model. 

This value determines the size of the word sequences (n-grams) the model uses for training and prediction, 
based on the preceding word. Please note that the number of possibilities grows exponentially with the value of n-grams, 
so caution is advised when setting this variable. 

A value of 6 is usually sufficient, while a higher value, like 15, might cause the program to freeze.

**Trained File Example**

```[
  "harry potter" => [
    "was" => 0.24,
    "is" => 0.18,
    "and" => 0.12,
    // other words and their probabilities
  ],
  "professor dumbledore" => [
    "was" => 0.35,
    "said" => 0.25,
    // other words and their probabilities
  ],
  // other n-grams and their following words with probabilities
]
```
